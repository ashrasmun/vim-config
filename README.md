# vim-config
My Vim configuration, more precisely GVim.

## Setup
0. Install Vim (duh)
1. Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
2. Clone the repo
3. Place the `_vimrc` in proper location - by default, it should be `C:\Program Files\(x86)\Vim\_vimrc`. That's going to be the file in which you redirect to repository files.
4. Setup [gvimfullscreen_win32](https://github.com/ashrasmun/gvimfullscreen_win32)
5. Set the `g:VIM_RC` and `g:VIM_GVIMFULLSCREEN_DLL` variables to point to proper locations on your hard drive.
6. You're done :)
